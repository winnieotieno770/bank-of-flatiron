# Bank of Flatiron
A react project for Bank of Flatiron allowing users to view, add and filter their transactions.

## Key Features
*   **View Transactions:** Displays a comprehensive table of all recent bank transactions fetched from a local API.
 **Add New Transactions:** Users can submit a form to add new transactions (deposits or withdrawals), which are persisted to the backend API.
*   **Filter/Search Functionality:** Allows users to filter the transaction table dynamically by entering a search term into the description field.
*   **Persistence:** Uses `json-server` and a `db.json` file to simulate a real backend database.
